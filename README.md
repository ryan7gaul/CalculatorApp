A simple calculator that takes in a user inputted string and returns a result.

The calculator can handle addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*,x) and division(/).

The app uses simple local user authorization.

History is saved and displayed on a per-user basis.

Before running the application, run the Entity Framework migrations. In Visual Studio, click Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console and type Update-Database.

When registering a user, be sure to click the link that fakes the email verification right after user creation occurs. The link says "Click here to confirm your account."
